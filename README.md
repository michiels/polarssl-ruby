PolarSSL for Ruby
=================

* API documentation: http://michiels.github.io/polarssl-ruby/doc

## Description

With PolarSSL for Ruby, you can use SSL and cryptography functionality from PolarSSL in your Ruby programs.

## Features

* Set up encrypted SSL connections.

## Installation

```
gem install polarssl
```

## Usage

This gem provides a pretty low level interface to the native PolarSSL C library.
The core API aims to reflect the PolarSSL library as much as possible. See the
[full API documentation](http://michiels.github.io/polarssl-ruby/doc/) for all classes and methods.

```ruby
require 'polarssl'

socket = TCPSocket.new('polarssl', 443)

entropy = PolarSSL::Entropy.new
ctr_drbg = PolarSSL::CtrDrbg.new(entropy)

ssl = PolarSSL::SSL.new
ssl.set_endpoint(PolarSSL::SSL::SSL_IS_CLIENT)
ssl.set_authmode(PolarSSL::SSL::SSL_VERIFY_NONE)
ssl.set_rng(ctr_drbg)
ssl.set_socket(socket)

ssl.handshake

ssl.write("GET / HTTP/1.0\r\nHost: polarssl.org\r\n\r\n")

while chunk = ssl.read(1024)
  response << chunk
end

puts response

ssl.close_notify

socket.close

ssl.close
```

The following steps and commands are followed during development:

1. A branch is created.
2. Tests are created in `test/` before code is written and ran with `rake test`. This rake task takes care of compiling the binary and executing the tests.
3. Code is written.
4. A pull request is created.
5. CI runs and verifies passing tests of the Pull Request.
6. The pull request is merged in.
7. Repeat.

Tools used when developing:

* Travis CI (http://travis-ci.org)
* MiniTest (built into Ruby 1.9 or newer)
* GitHub
